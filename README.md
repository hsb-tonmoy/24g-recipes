# 24g-recipes

This is my rendition of the 24G Recipe App Test Project. This is my first time using Vue.js 3 to build an SPA (singe page application). I used the Vite default TypeScript template to get started. Added TailwindCSS because of its handy utility classes. This was a great learning experience for me as I have taught myself the fundamentals of Vue's reactivity, the built-in directives, and the Composition API.
